Rocket League XP Script

Earns ~1.3k XP / minute, and works with the game in the background

# How it works
This script works by claiming the 20k XP reward for winning 10 games.
Two accounts owned by you (or you and a friend) enter into a casual 1v1, then after 1 minute 30 passes and the forfeit button unlocks, one account forfeits the match.
After 10 repeats, the XP gaining account will have unlocked the 20k XP reward, and the script will automatically claim it (For now, the Rocket League game window will open temporarily because Rocket League won't accept control clicks, but the window will automatically be backgrounded again after the rewards are claimed)

# How to use
Simply have two Rocket League accounts that are friends on steam, move the forfeiter to the top shelf of the XP Gainer's steam friend list (Like in this image https://imgur.com/a/aIQzX6I)

Then open the game in windowed mode on both accounts with different computers. Run the script on both computers, and select the relevant option (Forfeiter or XP Gainer)
Follow the instructions on the XP Gainer computer, until you reach "Press (Ctrl+Alt+B) To start the script." 
At this point, have either account search for a 1v1 Casual game. Then you must somehow get the other person to leave (my reccomended way is just to play the game, forfeit at 3:30 and then wait on the post-game screen until they leave)

Then, on the other account, right click the account in the lobby in your steam friends, and click on "Join Game". 
Ready Up on both accounts, and then press CTRL+ALT+B on both computers simultaneously as soon as the timer starts.

And that's all there is to it! From now on you can just leave the game in the background and do other things, every 15 minutes the game will open for a few seconds to claim the rewards, DO NOT CLICK OUTSIDE THE GAME WINDOW. The script will automatically bring the window you were using before back to the foreground once the rewards have been claimed.
